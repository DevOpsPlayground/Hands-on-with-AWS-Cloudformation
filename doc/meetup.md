Infrastructure as code (IaC) is the process of managing the provisioning of resources through machine readable definition files. AWS CloudFormation is Amazon's offering into this space.

CloudFormation brings the ability to code your Infrastructure as a template, utilizing parameters and other features enabling the reuse of templates so provisioning of resources on your AWS estate, can be done in a repeatable and controlled manner.

For this meetup we are going to be learning about creating CloudFormation Templates and provisioning stacks.

We will look at:

* Creating a simple stack with CloudFormation.
* Using Change Sets, understand how to observe changes to existing stacks before applying them.
* Launching an EC2 instance with a bootstrap script.

A few things to keep in mind:

* No prior knowledge is required.
* You do not need to download anything or create any accounts prior to the event.
* Food and drinks will be provided at the end of the playground.
* As this is a hands-on, please remember to bring your laptop :-)

Hope to see our regulars plus some new faces!
